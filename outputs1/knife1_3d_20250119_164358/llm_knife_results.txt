Parts reasoning response:
The node labeled 'rect0' with attributes indicating a rectangle shape, gray color, and an aspect ratio of approximately 2.777, likely represents the blade of the knife, given its elongated shape and typical color for a metal blade. The node labeled 'rect1', characterized by a rectangle shape, brown color, and a higher aspect ratio of 5.218, probably represents the handle of the knife, as handles are often narrower and can be made of materials like wood or plastic that are brown.

Part assignment response:
{"rect0": "blade", "rect1": "handle"}

Likelihoods reasoning response:
The 'rect1' node, representing the handle, is the most appropriate part for the gripper to interact with for proper control and safety, as gripping the blade ('rect0') could be unsafe and damage the gripper.

Likelihoods assignment response:
{"rect0": 0.1, "rect1": 0.9}

Predicted Node: rect1, Angle: 171, Centroid: [421 228 356]
